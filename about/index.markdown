There's not a whole lot to say about me. I am enthusiastic about games and the web. My goal is to learn as much as I can so that I can fulfill my dream of working in software development/web development.

I love dogs, (and cats, but dogs are better), reading, and meeting with friends.

Maybe one day I will put a resume here or something.
