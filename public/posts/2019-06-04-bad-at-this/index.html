<p><p>Wow it just never really seems to work out every time I try to get this blog going. I&rsquo;ll be honest here: I usually just forget it exists. It&rsquo;s easy to say to myself &ldquo;Oh I can wait to make another blog post.&rdquo; And, I&rsquo;ll keep telling myself that right up until I completely forget about the blog entirely.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be going back and doing some editing (some of my posts sorely require it) and maybe this time I can actually stick with it.</p>
<p>I have been playing around with Godot recently because of how lightweight and pleasent it is. I think it will become my prototyping tool of choice. I might even try to complete a full game in it. So far it&rsquo;s going pretty smoothly.</p>
<p>With school and other obligations my free time is getting stretched pretty thin, but everything should work out.</p>
