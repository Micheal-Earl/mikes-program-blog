<h1>Rust and C</h1>
<h1>Single.html</h1>
<p><p>I made a post a while back about how I need to pick something and really go at it for a while. Finally, I have come to a decision regarding that post. My focus from this point will be on systems level programming (with some web).</p>
<p>C has always been really fun for me. I like having powerful low level control, but I&rsquo;m less thrilled about all the pitfalls that I encounter. Using C for large projects is definitely not beginner friendly. This brings me to Rust, which isn&rsquo;t really easier, but inherently avoids many of the pitfalls prevelant in C. I feel that using both languages will give me strong fundamentals in systems level programming.</p>
