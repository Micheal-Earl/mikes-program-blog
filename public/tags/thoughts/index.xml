      <description>As I’m about to graduate with my bachelor’s degree in computer science, I’ve been thinking more and more about my journey up to this point.
Really, I’ve discovered that I have a lot less to show for it than I thought. Most of my work is broken up into fragmented minor projects or school work that I couldn’t really apply passion to.
So what do I do? My solution is to treat the creation of my portfolio like a job.</description>

      <description>Wow it just never really seems to work out every time I try to get this blog going. I&amp;rsquo;ll be honest here: I usually just forget it exists. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to say to myself &amp;ldquo;Oh I can wait to make another blog post.&amp;rdquo; And, I&amp;rsquo;ll keep telling myself that right up until I completely forget about the blog entirely.
I&amp;rsquo;ll be going back and doing some editing (some of my posts sorely require it) and maybe this time I can actually stick with it.</description>
