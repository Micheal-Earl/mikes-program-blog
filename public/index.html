  <p>As I’m about to graduate with my bachelor’s degree in computer science, I’ve been thinking more and more about my journey up to this point.</p>
<p>Really, I’ve discovered that I have a lot less to show for it than I thought. Most of my work is broken up into fragmented minor projects or school work that I couldn’t <em>really</em> apply passion to.</p>
<p>So what do I do? My solution is to treat the creation of my portfolio like a job. I expect to work on it certain hours each day and to make incremental progress for the next few months.</p>
<p>Writing here in my blog is just another aspect of my portfolio. I want to fully explore the software engineering process and record my thoughts as I go. I want to look back on these projects and <em>learn</em> something from them even years from now.</p>
<p>That being said, I’m still brainstorming what will go in my portfolio. Scope is difficult for me to judge. I know that “GitHub for musicians” is massive in scope and that “Metacritic for recipes” is smaller. But how much smaller? Could I finish the latter in under a month and have a genuine product to show for it?</p>
<p>Only time will tell.</p>

  <p>Godot is a lot of fun to use and, in my opinion, may be the best platform available for teaching people how to program. Godot is very lightweight (~50mb) with no dependencies, it is completely open source under the <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/LICENSE.txt">MIT License</a>, it supports both 2d and 3d game development, and its scripting language is python-esque.</p>
<p>I think all of those things are excellent reasons for beginners to use Godot. However, that isn&rsquo;t to say Godot doesn&rsquo;t suit advanced programmers. Godot supports several programming languages including C, C++, and C#, you can crack into the engine and make changes yourself if you run into any problems, and there are a ton of open source projects using Godot that you can look at to get a feel for the engine.</p>
<p>The biggest benefit for me, personally, is performance. Godot can run on very low end machines. Unity and Unreal take a lot of system resources which is not very helpful when I&rsquo;m doing a lot of my work on a laptop with a duo core from a few years ago.</p>
<p>You can download Godot <a href="https://godotengine.org/download/windows">here</a> for free.</p>
<p>Once Godot is downloaded unzip it wherever you&rsquo;d like. It should just be a single executable. Double click the executable to launch the engine. From this point you can just start making games. I love the simplicity.</p>
<p>I will be working on a simple metroidvania tutorial here on my blog over time. I kind of hope to release the whole thing all at once so it might be a bit before it goes live.</p>

  <p>Wow it just never really seems to work out every time I try to get this blog going. I&rsquo;ll be honest here: I usually just forget it exists. It&rsquo;s easy to say to myself &ldquo;Oh I can wait to make another blog post.&rdquo; And, I&rsquo;ll keep telling myself that right up until I completely forget about the blog entirely.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be going back and doing some editing (some of my posts sorely require it) and maybe this time I can actually stick with it.</p>
<p>I have been playing around with Godot recently because of how lightweight and pleasent it is. I think it will become my prototyping tool of choice. I might even try to complete a full game in it. So far it&rsquo;s going pretty smoothly.</p>
<p>With school and other obligations my free time is getting stretched pretty thin, but everything should work out.</p>
