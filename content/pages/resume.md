## Summary

I am driven to learn new technologies and deep dive into what makes them tick. I have 2 years of web
development experience, a decade of tinkering under my belt, and I am proficient in all areas of web development
with a focus on the back end. I have used many ORM's, databases, and server languages. My preferences are
Node.js and MongoDB, but I still learn new things every day and strive to find the best toolkit for whatever problem
I am facing.
