## Summary
I am driven to learn new technologies and to dive deeply into what makes them tick. Tinkering with web technologies has been a focus of mine for over 15 years. I have used many tech stacks that include various web frameworks, ORM's, and databases. My preferred tools are JavaScript, Python, Django, and PostgreSQL, but I still learn new things every day and strive to find the best toolkit for whatever problem I'm facing.
