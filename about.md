So, a few things about me. I like reading, programming, and playing video games. I have always aspired to be an author, but lately programming has me in a vice grip. Please forgive my grammatical mistakes! I donâ€™t do a lot of writing.

I find that game development lets me combine all of my passions. I get to write a story for my game, program the functionality, and read even more books to get inspiration.
