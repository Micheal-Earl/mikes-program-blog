  <p>Godot is a lot of fun to use and, in my opinion, may be the best platform available for teaching people how to program. Godot is very lightweight (~50mb) with no dependencies, it is completely open source under the <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/LICENSE.txt">MIT License</a>, it supports both 2d and 3d game development, and its scripting language is python-esque.</p>
<p>I think all of those things are excellent reasons for beginners to use Godot. However, that isn&rsquo;t to say Godot doesn&rsquo;t suit advanced programmers. Godot supports several programming languages including C, C++, and C#, you can crack into the engine and make changes yourself if you run into any problems, and there are a ton of open source projects using Godot that you can look at to get a feel for the engine.</p>
<p>The biggest benefit for me, personally, is performance. Godot can run on very low end machines. Unity and Unreal take a lot of system resources which is not very helpful when I&rsquo;m doing a lot of my work on a laptop with a duo core from a few years ago.</p>
<p>You can download Godot <a href="https://godotengine.org/download/windows">here</a> for free.</p>
<p>Once Godot is downloaded unzip it wherever you&rsquo;d like. It should just be a single executable. Double click the executable to launch the engine. From this point you can just start making games. I love the simplicity.</p>
<p>I will be working on a simple metroidvania tutorial here on my blog over time. I kind of hope to release the whole thing all at once so it might be a bit before it goes live.</p>

  <p>Wow it just never really seems to work out every time I try to get this blog going. I&rsquo;ll be honest here: I usually just forget it exists. It&rsquo;s easy to say to myself &ldquo;Oh I can wait to make another blog post.&rdquo; And, I&rsquo;ll keep telling myself that right up until I completely forget about the blog entirely.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be going back and doing some editing (some of my posts sorely require it) and maybe this time I can actually stick with it.</p>
<p>I have been playing around with Godot recently because of how lightweight and pleasent it is. I think it will become my prototyping tool of choice. I might even try to complete a full game in it. So far it&rsquo;s going pretty smoothly.</p>
<p>With school and other obligations my free time is getting stretched pretty thin, but everything should work out.</p>

  <p>I just got back home from my trip to Canada. I had a lot of fun during the trip, but I am glad to be back home so I can start getting some work done. My next semester of college begins in only two weeks, and most of the classes are still general education.</p>
<p>Making sure that I&rsquo;m always learning something new about technology is a must. Becoming complacent would be very bad at this step in my life. My plan is to have at least one commit to github every single day. This will make sure that I think about programming every single day, even if that commit is just a change to the blog.</p>
<p>Mike from the future: Yeah that commit a day thing never really took off. I&rsquo;ll be attempting it again now though! 2019-06-04</p>
