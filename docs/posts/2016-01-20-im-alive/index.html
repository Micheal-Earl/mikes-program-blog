# tags to render markdown content
<h1>I&#39;m Alive</h1>
<h1>Single.html</h1>
<p><p>Sorry I haven&rsquo;t been very active these past few weeks. I&rsquo;ve been preparing myself to move back to the city. I&rsquo;ll finally have a decent internet connection again! I&rsquo;m looking forward to getting all this moving stuff over with.</p>
<p>I originally wanted to write a post about event handlers in C#, but I&rsquo;ve been too distracted. This is going to be a pretty short post.</p>
<p>I will be writing new posts in the future, so if anyone is actually reading this you can expect some content in the next week or so.</p>
