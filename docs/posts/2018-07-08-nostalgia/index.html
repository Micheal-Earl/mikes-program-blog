<h1>Nostalgia</h1>
<h1>Single.html</h1>
<p><p>Writing has always been a difficult beast for me. Every time I sit down to write something, I just fail to bring anything <em>substantial</em> to mind. I don&rsquo;t live a fanciful life of tantalizing adventure but, rather, a fanciful life of mediocre preservation.</p>
<p>Every time I come back to trying to write on my blog, my eyes are drawn to my first post: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still alive&rdquo;. Ironic, because that is not actually my first post. My first two posts were deleted by me when I wrote &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still alive.&rdquo; Perhaps I thought that I could just retcon those posts out of my life.</p>
<p>You see, I constantly suffer from a serious case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">Imposter Syndrome</a>. Everything I do feels like walking through a deep pool of molasses. There is this extra resistance that seems to be tacked on to every task. Why should I try to write about my programming discoveries when dozens, or even hundreds of other people have already outdone my solutions. How do I know if something is good enough?</p>
<p>This brings me back to &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still alive.&rdquo; It is a small post that I wrote as an attempt to convince myself to try writing again, but it clearly did not work (as evinced by the 2+ year gap in posts). Even though I feel that this post is superfluos, small, and insignigant, I do think that I will keep it here. I am done retconning my past. Or, maybe, it&rsquo;s just nostalgia.</p>
