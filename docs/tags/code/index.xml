      <description>Godot is a lot of fun to use and, in my opinion, may be the best platform available for teaching people how to program. Godot is very lightweight (~50mb) with no dependencies, it is completely open source under the MIT License, it supports both 2d and 3d game development, and its scripting language is python-esque.
I think all of those things are excellent reasons for beginners to use Godot. However, that isn&amp;rsquo;t to say Godot doesn&amp;rsquo;t suit advanced programmers.</description>

      <description>Well this blog didn&amp;rsquo;t really take off. I just can&amp;rsquo;t spin up the effort to write something every day. I&amp;rsquo;ve recently gotten into Lua and the LOVE 2d game library. Playing around with that has been pretty fun.
I&amp;rsquo;m using a library in lua to help me implement OOP functionality. The library is called classical.lua and you can find it here.
You can see some notes I made on the usage of the classical library in my repo here</description>
