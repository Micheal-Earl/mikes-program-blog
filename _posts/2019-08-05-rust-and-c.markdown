Wow it just never really seems to work out every time I try to get this blog going. I'll be honest here: usually I just forget it exists. It's easy to say to myself "Oh I can wait to make another blog post." And I'll keep telling myself that right up until I completely forget about it alltogether.

I'll be going back and doing some editing (some of my posts sorely require it) and maybe this time I can actually stick with it.

I have been playing around with Godot recently because of how lightweight and pleasent it is. I think it will become my prototyping tool of choice. I might even try to complete a full game in it. So far it's going pretty smoothly.

With school and other obligations my free time is getting stretched pretty thin, but everything should work out.
