So, a few things about me. I like reading, programming, and playing video games. I have always aspired to be an author, but lately programming has me in a vice grip. Please forgive my grammatical mistakes! I don't do a lot of writing.

I find that game development lets me combine all of my passions. I get to write a story for my game, program the functionality, and read even more books to get inspiration.

I've had trouble with accountability lately. I find myself watching videos on Youtube, or reading a novel instead of working on my programming skills. This brings me to the blog; I decided I needed a little something to hold me accountable (and I can brush up on my writing skills while I'm at it).

You can expect to find mostly programming related content on this blog, especially when it comes to game development. In addition to all that I'm sure I'll occasionally post about books, or about the stories I've come up with for the games I want to make.

I don't know if anyone will actually read this, but it doesn't matter too much. At least I'll have a log of my progress!

Console.WriteLine("Time to test out this C# syntax highlighter");
Console.WriteLine("Cool, it works!");
