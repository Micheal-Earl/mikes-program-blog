I'm making minimal changes to the default template jekyll provided me with. I plan to make some much larger improvements over time, but I feel that the small changes are suiting my style for the time being. That being said, if any readers have suggestions be sure to email me at the address in the sites footer.

I'm also looking for examples of blogs/sites built with jekyll. If you guys know of any sites you think look exceptional or interesting be sure to send them my way.
